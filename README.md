# AbstractOcclusion.WebGpuWater — GPU water for Unity 6 / URP

> **Renders entirely on the GPU via Unity 6 WebGPU (experimental) — so this runs not just on
> desktop but in the browser and on some mobile devices and tablets. Water of this quality
> shipping to the web is the "wait, this runs _here_?" moment. (Tablet gameplay video coming soon.)**

> **Based on the original [WebGL Water](https://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/) by
> [Evan Wallace](https://madebyevan.com/) (2011, MIT).** The GPU heightfield
> simulation, the in-shader ray-traced reflection/refraction and the projected
> caustics are his ideas, and full credit for that original design belongs to him.
>
> This project *began* as a faithful Unity 6 + URP **port** of that demo, but has
> since grown into a full Unity **adaptation and enhancement** — re-architected
> around real Unity rendering and physics and extended well beyond the original
> feature set. See the original: https://madebyevan.com/webgl-water/ and

![WebGL Water running in Unity 6 / URP — a tiled pool with a half-submerged ball, surface ripples and floor caustics](docs/screenshot.png)

**▶ [Live demo](https://abstractocclusionshowreel.web.app/projects/ewan-water.html)** —
runs in the browser via Unity 6 **WebGPU** (needs a WebGPU-capable browser:
Chrome / Edge, Safari 26+, or the latest Firefox).

An interactive pool of water you can poke and ripple, drop real objects into, and
watch them float — with real-time caustics, reflections and shadows, running on
the GPU inside Unity.

## A full Unity adaptation — not just a port

The goal was not to stop at a 1:1 translation of the 2011 demo, but to make it a
*native* Unity citizen and push it further. The original's clever analytic
shortcuts — a single hard-coded ball, faked reflection/refraction of an analytic
pool, a painted-on blob shadow, a hand-typed light vector — have been replaced
with real Unity rendering and physics. The water now lives in an actual scene with
arbitrary objects, real lights and real shadows.

### Enhancements over the original

- **Hybrid real-time reflections** — screen-space reflections (SSR) blended with a
  planar mirror reflection of the live scene, falling back to the sky cubemap; both
  toggleable per material.
- **True transparency** — optional screen-space refraction samples the real scene
  *behind* the surface instead of a faked analytic pool, so anything in the water
  is genuinely visible through it.
- **Two-way object interaction** — the scripted ball is gone. Any object marked
  `WaterInteractable` displaces the surface through a GPU obstacle map (generalising
  the original sphere kernel to arbitrary meshes), and `WaterBuoyancy` reads the
  height field back via `AsyncGPUReadback` so objects float and bob — full two-way
  coupling.
- **Real Unity lighting** — the hand-typed light vector is gone; one Unity
  **directional light** now drives the water surface, the caustics projection and
  real shadows together. Move the sun and everything tracks it.
- **Real shadows & caustics on geometry** — objects cast and receive URP shadows,
  the pool receives them too, and submerged objects catch the projected caustics on
  their own surfaces.
- **Ambient wind waves & foam** — an analytic spectral (JONSWAP-shaped) wind-wave
  layer is composited on top of the interactive ripples (floating objects ride it
  too), with GPU foam along shorelines, at object contact lines and from turbulence.
- **Underwater god-ray shafts** — a caustic-masked additive light volume with hybrid
  real-shadow shafts, so floating objects carve dark beams through the haze.
- **Depth-aware water colour** — per-channel downwelling darkening makes deeper water
  read darker and bluer, and caustics and god rays fade with depth; god rays also haze
  into the view-path fog. All opt-in, with independent per-effect controls.
- **Real terrain lake beds** — bakes a Unity Terrain heightmap into a bed-depth map so
  the surface shows a true shoreline gradient (clear in the shallows, dark over the
  drop-off) over uneven ground.
- **Deep, rectangular & rotated bodies** — non-uniform volume extent places and sizes
  the water without touching object scales; wave/ripple height is correctly decoupled
  from depth, so deep water no longer spikes.
- **Multiple water bodies** — several independent lakes coexist via per-body
  `MaterialPropertyBlock`s; a floating object is lit by whichever body it's actually in.
- **Showcase scenes** — eight example scenes (classic pool, deep lake, terrain lake,
  multi-lake, underwater, open water, reflections trio, object pool), shipped as an importable
  Package Manager sample.

## Features

- **GPU heightfield simulation** — 256×256 ping-pong float texture driven by a
  compute shader (drop / wave-propagation / normal / obstacle-displacement kernels).
- **Hybrid reflections** — analytic sky → planar → SSR, blended and toggleable.
- **Real transparency** — optional screen-space refraction of the live scene.
- **Two-way object interaction** — GPU obstacle displacement + async-readback buoyancy.
- **Projected caustics** — on the pool floor/walls *and* on submerged objects.
- **Real lighting & shadows** — a Unity directional light drives water, caustics and
  URP shadows; objects cast/receive, the pool receives.
- **Volume conservation** — the surface stays level no matter how hard you ripple it.
- **Reusable orbit camera** — drag to orbit, scroll to zoom.
- **Designer knobs** — wave speed, damping, sub-steps, ripple strength/radius,
  reflection strength, obstacle strength and buoyancy, all exposed in the inspector.
- **One-window authoring** — the **Water Wizard** builds a configured water surface (size,
  analytic pool, god rays, foam particles, surface + edge foam) and can turn your own scene
  objects into floating or interactable props, generating the sky cubemap, light and materials
  for you.

## Requirements

- **Unity 6** (developed on `6000.3.9f1`).
- **Universal Render Pipeline** (`17.3.0`). The base assembly compiles without URP, but the
  water needs URP for its full look (planar reflection, screen-space refraction).
- A GPU that supports **compute shaders** and **RGBAFloat** random-write
  textures (any modern desktop/console GPU; GLES3.1+/Metal/Vulkan on mobile).

## Install

WebGpuWater ships as a UPM package, **`com.abstractocclusion.webgpuwater`**. Add it to a
Unity 6 / URP project by copying the package into your project's `Packages/` folder (embedded),
or via **Window ▸ Package Manager ▸ + ▸ Add package from disk…** pointed at its `package.json`.

## Quick start

1. Let Unity import the package (no console errors expected).
2. Open **AbstractOcclusion ▸ WebGpuWater ▸ Water Wizard**.
3. Set the size and toggle what you want — analytic pool, god rays, foam particles, surface
   foam (and the conditional **edge foam**) — optionally drag scene objects into the list to
   make them **Floatable** or **Interactable**, then press **Create Water Surface**.
4. Press **Play**.

The wizard generates the meshes, materials, a procedural sky cubemap and a fallback tile
texture under `Assets/WebGLWater/Generated/` (in your project, not the read-only package), and
wires up the camera and the `WaterVolume`. One-off utilities — create prefab, add foam particles
to a selection, assign foam textures, upgrade splash materials, add a secondary body — live in
the same window under **Utilities**.

## Demo scenes

The eight example scenes ship as a Package Manager **sample**. In **Package Manager ▸
AbstractOcclusion.WebGpuWater ▸ Samples**, import **Demo Scenes** to drop them — along with the
generated meshes, sky and materials they depend on — into `Assets/Samples/…`.

## Controls

| Action | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Drag on the water | Make ripples |
| Drag the background | Orbit the camera |
| Scroll wheel | Zoom |
| **Space** | Pause / resume the simulation |
| **L** (hold) | Point the sun along the camera view |

> Drop real objects in by giving them a `Rigidbody`, a `Collider`,
> `WaterInteractable` and `WaterBuoyancy` — they'll displace the surface and float.

## Tuning (WaterVolume inspector)

| Knob | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| **Wave Speed** (0.1–2.0) | Propagation stiffness. Higher = faster, livelier waves (stable up to ~2.0). |
| **Damping** (0.90–1.0) | How quickly ripples fade. Lower = choppier; toward 1.0 = glassy. |
| **Steps Per Frame** (1–8) | Simulation sub-steps. More = faster, smoother propagation. |
| **Ripple Strength / Radius** | Size and intensity of a click/drag ripple. |
| **Conserve Volume** | Keeps the surface from drifting up/down as ripples are added. |
| **Reflection Strength** (0–1) | On the water materials. 1 = original Fresnel; 0 = fully see-through. |
| **Obstacle Strength** | How hard submerged objects push the surface down. |
| **Buoyancy** (on `WaterBuoyancy`) | Float strength; higher rides higher. |

> Reflection / transparency toggles live on the **water materials**: *Use Planar
> Reflection*, *Use Screen Space Reflection* and *Real (Screen-Space) Refraction*.
> SSR and refraction need **Depth Texture** + **Opaque Texture** enabled on the URP asset.

> Presets — *calm pond:* waveSpeed ~1.0, damping ~0.99, steps 2.
> *energetic:* waveSpeed 2.0, damping 0.997, steps 3–4, higher ripple strength.

## Using your own pool

The water surface ray-traces an **analytic** pool defined in normalized space:
floor at `y = -1`, walls up to `y = 2/12`, spanning `x,z ∈ [-1, 1]` (1 unit = the
demo's unit). For your own pool's reflections to match, keep it at those
dimensions and assign your tile texture to **WaterVolume ▸ Tiles**.

## How it maps to the original

| Original (`evanw/webgl-water`) | This adaptation |
| --- | --- |
| `water.js` | `WaterSim.compute` (+ generalised obstacle kernel) + `WaterSimulation.cs` |
| `renderer.js` helper functions | `WaterCommon.hlsl` |
| water / cube shaders | `WaterSurface` (hybrid reflection + real refraction) / `PoolWall` (URP, shadow-receiving) |
| sphere shader + ball physics | **removed** — replaced by `WaterInteractable` + `WaterObstacle` + `WaterBuoyancy` for arbitrary objects |
| `updateCaustics` | `Caustics.shader` drawn into a 1024² RT via a CommandBuffer |
| `main.js` (input, camera, physics) | `WaterVolume.cs` + `OrbitCamera.cs` |
| _(new)_ planar reflection | `PlanarReflection.cs` |
| _(new)_ lit objects + caustics + shadows | `WaterReceiver.shader` driven by a real Unity directional light |

There's a more detailed developer guide in the package README
(`Packages/com.abstractocclusion.webgpuwater/README.md`), including the few in-editor tweaks you
may need (face-culling direction, caustic Y-flip, color space).

## Using it in a game

The water is a self-contained **`WaterVolume`** component you drop into any scene; several bodies
coexist (each drives its own sim and pushes per-body state through a `MaterialPropertyBlock`), and
the gameplay primitives are already there — world-space height queries, `AddRipple`, buoyancy and
submersion tests. That makes it usable for contained water in a real **desktop-URP** game today.

Still on the roadmap before it's turnkey for every target: a high-level gameplay event API
(enter/exit water, a clean façade over the internals), many-body performance culling and quality
tiers, scene-view handles for the volume, and hardening the `AsyncGPUReadback` buoyancy path on
WebGPU/mobile (where readback is unreliable, objects sink rather than float). See
[`docs/game-integration-plan.md`](docs/game-integration-plan.md).

## Known limitations

It's a **contained, heightfield** water — great for pools, ponds and lakes, not oceans. It
simulates vertical displacement only (no breaking waves). The interactive ripple sim is a
fixed-resolution grid over the body, so on a very **large** body the interactive ripples get
coarse; the analytic wind waves stay fine everywhere, and a camera-following, world-anchored
interactive-sim window for big water is planned (see
[`docs/large-water-sim-window-plan.md`](docs/large-water-sim-window-plan.md)).

**Reflections don't all scale.** Planar reflection is a second camera render *per body*, so it
does not scale to many bodies — use SSR + a reflection probe for multi-body scenes and reserve
planar for a single hero body.

**Mobile / WebGPU are experimental.** The WebGPU backend is still experimental in Unity: the
buoyancy `AsyncGPUReadback` path is unreliable there (objects sink rather than float), and the
WebGPU build has crashed on some phones — gate it behind a `navigator.gpu` / capability check.
A couple of newer features (GPU foam particles, the wind-wave layer) are shipped but not yet
fully verified on the WebGPU build.
